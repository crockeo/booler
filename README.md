# booler

A utility for verifying and generating symmetric boolean calculus statements.

A symmetric boolean statement is one that holds true for every permutation of
n variables being true.

### Installation / Usage

To install & use the program, simply run it like you would any other Scala
program. I personally build with `sbt`.
